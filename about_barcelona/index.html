				<h2 class="main"> Barcelona Architecture</h2>
				<p class="text">Barcelona is a city with mind-blowing architecture. When you first encounter Antoni Gaudí's La Sagrada Familia or his rooftop sculptures at La Pedrera, you'll be floored by the originality and hallucinogenic quality of his works. There's much in Barcelona unlike anything you've ever seen.
				Barcelona architecture is, in reality, an attraction in itself. Just stroll around the city, especially through the Gothic Quarter and the Eixample, and you'll find an endless amount of fascinating buildings and unexpected treasures.
				From Roman times to the Gothic period to the Catalan Art Nouveau, "modernisme," Barcelona's architecture naturally transmits the city's rich history. It speaks for eras of varying prosperity and decline, for fervent Catalan nationalism or subjugation to the central government, for Expos, Olympic Games, Cultural Forums and more.
				The two most important styles of Barcelona architecture are Catalan Gothic, a medieval style, and Modernisme, a turn of the 20th century movement protagonized by Antoni Gaudí.
				Apart from the Middle Ages and Barcelona's turn of the 20th century "Renaixença" (Catalan Renaissance) it's well worth mentioning the city's ancient remains.
			    You can see significant sections of the 4th century Roman walls at the Museu d'Història de la Ciutat and inside the Cathedral's Casa de L'Ardiaca, the Archdeacon's House.</p>

				<p class="text">Many call it the City of Gaudi, but Barcelona is much more than just that: it is a dazzling spectacle of architectural talent, culture, passion, and energy; a huge outdoor museum; and a revelation to sightseers.
				From famous Modernista pioneers like Antoni Gaudi, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Lluís Domènech i Montaner to award-winning contemporary architects and design masters, this city has works by the world’s most highly-acclaimed artists – no wonder it’s a real treat for architecture lovers worldwide.
				For a true taste of Catalan Art Nouveau, don’t miss the Passeig de Gracia’s Illa de la Discordia with its three intriguing Modernista masterpieces – Casa Lleó Morera, Casa Amatller, and Casa Batllo; or the fabulous Palau de la Musica Catalana and the UNESCO-listed Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau.
				The Passeig de Gracia in the Eixample district is also an excellent place to start your Gaudi route, playing host to treasures such as Casa Batllo and Casa Mila (La Pedrera), the latter being situated at the intersection of Passeig de Gracia and Carrer de Mallorca. Walk about 1.5 kilometers down this street and you will arrive at Gaudi’s most famous work of art – the unfinished, yet majestic Sagrada Familia. Complete your itinerary with a visit to the fantastic Parc Guell to see what is probably the architect’s most creative achievement.
				Although the Catalan Art Nouveau is Barcelona’s most prominent art movement, there are countless architectural styles well represented throughout this handsome metropolis. Ciutat Vella (Old Town), for instance, is a fascinating exemplification of Medieval Barcelona, greeting visitors with picturesque narrow streets, beautiful Gothic churches, and Romanesque buildings, while Barri Gotic offers an impressive collection of Roman sights.
				Nevertheless, the city’s contemporary architecture doesn’t lack at all in outstanding works. Some of the most intriguing structures comprise the astounding Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA), designed by the renowned American architect Richard Meier; the Agbar Tower – a state-of-the-art 38-story skyscraper conceived by French architect Jean Nouvel in association with b720 Fermin Vázquez Arquitectos; Norman Foster’s Torre de Collserola; the Palau Sant Jordi by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki; the innovative Forum Building by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron; and Frank Gehry’s giant Fish (Peix), at the foot of the beautiful Hotel Arts.
